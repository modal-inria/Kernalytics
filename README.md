Kernel-powered analytics.

Kernel methods are versatile, Kernalytics provides a generic computational engine to take advantage of those properties. kernalyzr is a small R wrapper around Kernalytics.

# Quick start for kernalyzr

Install sbt on your machine (see [Build instructions](doc/build.md)). Open the kernalyzr directory in RStudio, then press `CRTL + SHIFT + B`.

To create and run some working examples in the (preferably empty) current directory, type the following commands in the R console:

```R
library(kernalyzr) # load kernalyz
copyTest() # generate the test cases
runTest() # run kernalyz algorithms on each test case
```
