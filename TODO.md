# Short Term

- implement string kernel, see Gartner
- implement graph kernel
  - first the one based on laplacian by Celisse
  - then the one proposed in Gartner

# Long Term

# Architecture

- Real and Index types are defined to avoid setting the types directly. However, .toInt and .toReal methods are used for conversion. Any mention to Int and Double should be removed.
- Use TypeTag instead of encapsulating types in KerEval, for example
- Better management of Option, when .get is used
- DenseVectorRoot involves a lot of pattern-matching scattered across multiple files. Maybe it would be best to change the architecture to centralize the descriptions of behaviours.
  - See: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/48169051/how-to-avoid-type-argument-erasure/48170083?noredirect=1#comment83372119_48170083
  - once kerEval are generated, this problem disappears... So is it worth investigating ?
- rkhs.IO should be more automated, maybe by just maintaining lists of possibles combinations of kernels and datatypes ?
- in p00, p01, p02, p03, p04, use TypeDef Index and Real, instead of the underlying types

# Check

- Exception messages generated using new Exception start with java.lang.Exception. Could this be removed to indicate that the exception has been generated by Kernalytics ?

# Mathematics

- A normed space requires a vector space, not an inner product space. This should be reflected in the corresponding traits.
- remove the deprecation warnings using -deprecation

# Performances

- the loop over D for a given tauP can be parallelized.
  - Will the gain outweight the overhead for thread spawning ?
  - That would depend on the value of DMax.
- Gram matrix symmetry should be exploited to reduce computational times.
