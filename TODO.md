# Short Term

- export both best
- create a document with the current capabilities and limitations
    - for example matrix model implemented, but not its IO
- implement string kernel, see Gartner
- implement graph kernel
  - first the one based on laplacian by Celisse
  - then the one proposed in Gartner

# Long Term

# Algorithm

- Change point detection
    - rewrite it using loops and mutable states ?

# Architecture

- Real and Index types are defined to avoid setting the types directly. However, .toInt and .toReal methods are used for conversion. Any mention to Int and Double should be removed.
- Use TypeTag instead of encapsulating types in KerEval, for example
- Better management of Option, when .get is used
- DenseVectorRoot involves a lot of pattern-matching scattered across multiple files. Maybe it would be best to change the architecture to centralize the descriptions of behaviours.

  - once kerEval are generated, this problem disappears... So is it worth investigating ?
- rkhs.IO should be more automated, maybe by just maintaining lists of possibles combinations of kernels and datatypes ?
- in p00, p01, p02, p03, p04, use TypeDef Index and Real, instead of the underlying types

# Computation

- Regression and MMD are ignoring cache directives (alogo.csv/gramOpti). Algorithms should be written to take them into account.

# Check

- Exception messages generated using new Exception start with java.lang.Exception. Could this be removed to indicate that the exception has been generated by Kernalytics ?
- In segmentation, check that the maximum number of required segment is smaller than the number of time steps

# kernalyzr

- write basic documentation in R, so that R user can copy tests on current directory
- use data frame instead of files on disk
    - Data and Desc are arrays of strings in R ?
    - Same format as the csv files ?
- rscala::scalaSBT will support sbt assembly in the future. when that is the case, remove the updateAssembly.sh script at the root, and simplify the configure script.

# Mathematics

- A normed space requires a vector space, not an inner product space. This should be reflected in the corresponding traits.
- remove the deprecation warnings using -deprecation
- Nystrom approximation pour faible rang: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low-rank_matrix_approximations

# Performances

- the loop over D for a given tauP can be parallelized.
  - Will the gain outweight the overhead for thread spawning ?
  - That would depend on the value of DMax.
  - is it possible to do it for the mutable state version ?
- Gram matrix symmetry should be exploited to reduce computational times.
- Perform tests to provide spectrum of Gram matrix and check that it decreases very quickly
